# Security Policy

This repository primarily focuses on hardware design for home automation and IoT control boards. As it deals with physical components, the emphasis is on reporting vulnerabilities that could affect the functionality and security of these devices. (Things that make stuff go **boom**).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within the project, please follow these steps to report it:

1. **Go to the Issues tab:** Visit the [Issues](https://github.com/enriquewph/esp-map/issues) section of this repository.

2. **Create a new issue:** Click on the "New Issue" button.

3. **Choose the "Security Vulnerability" template:** Select the template specifically designed for reporting security-related concerns.

4. **Provide details:** Fill in the template with as much information as possible. Include a clear and concise description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce it, and any additional context that might be helpful.

5. **Expect regular updates:** We will strive to provide timely updates on the progress of the reported vulnerability. Depending on the complexity and severity, it may take some time to address and resolve the issue.

6. **Acceptance or Declination:** Once the reported vulnerability is reviewed, you will be notified about whether it is accepted or declined. If accepted, information about the fix and a timeline for implementation will be provided.

We appreciate your efforts in helping to keep our hardware designs secure. Your collaboration is crucial in maintaining the integrity and reliability of our IoT control boards.

Thank you for your commitment to ~~security~~ keeping things from going **boom**.
